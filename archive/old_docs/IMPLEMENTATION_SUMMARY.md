## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Pricing Model Unification

### 2. Fixed False Claims

- ✅ "50+ adapters" → "7+ adapters" (updated in homepage, FAQ, getting started guide)
- ✅ "Fully automated" → "Automated with flexible scheduling" (all marketing pages)
- ✅ "Real-time" → "Event-driven" or "Near real-time" (all pages)
- ✅ "99.7% accuracy" → "High accuracy" (homepage, removed specific percentage)
- ✅ "<50ms API latency" → "Fast API response" (homepage)
- ✅ "5-minute setup" → "Quick setup in under 30 minutes" (all pages)

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Placeholders

### PDF Export

- **Status:** Placeholder implementation
- **Location:** `packages/api/src/routes/exports.ts`
- **Issue:** Returns JSON response instead of actual PDF file
- **Action Required:** Implement PDF generation using library like `pdfkit` or `puppeteer`

### Multi-Currency

- **Status:** Implementation exists and appears functional
- **Location:** `packages/api/src/application/currency/FXService.ts`
- **Note:** FX rates need to be populated (either via external API or manual entry)
- **Action Required:** Integrate FX rate provider (e.g., ECB, OANDA) or document manual rate entry
