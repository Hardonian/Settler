# Ecosystem Positioning & Clarity

## 🎯 Core Positioning & Clarity

### Clarity Mandate (5-Word Value Proposition)

**"Automate financial reconciliation instantly"**

This captures the essence: we solve the problem of manual, time-consuming financial reconciliation by providing instant, automated solutions.

### Target Persona (TP) Statement

**"Developers and finance teams at SaaS and e-commerce companies struggle with manual reconciliation across multiple payment platforms, wasting hours matching transactions between systems, and need a developer-first API that automates this process with high accuracy and real-time visibility."**

### Interdependence Manifesto (Vercel ↔ Supabase)

#### 1. **Data is Lifeblood**

Supabase _must_ power all public/private content. Every piece of information displayed on the frontend originates from Supabase tables. No static data post-initial setup. All content is dynamic, queryable, and real-time.

#### 2. **Vercel is the Skin**

The Next.js frontend optimizes for Lighthouse 95+ and acts as the user's sensory input layer. It provides:

- Server Components for efficient data fetching
- Server Actions as the exclusive write channel
- Client Components only for stateful interactivity (toasts, modals, real-time subscriptions)

#### 3. **Functions are Nerves**

Next.js Server Actions/Route Handlers are the _only_ channels for client-side writes, ensuring:

- All writes go through RLS checks
- Data integrity is maintained
- Audit trails are automatically created
- Real-time updates propagate correctly

## 🔄 Community Building & Smoke Signals

### The "Loud & High" Public Dashboard

The public dashboard (`/dashboard`) displays real-time aggregated social proof metrics:

- **New Users This Week**: Count from `profiles` table
- **Actions Completed in Last Hour**: Count from `activity_log` table
- **Most Engaged Post**: Calculated from `posts` table (views + upvotes \* 2)

These metrics act as "smoke signals" of a live, active ecosystem.

### Community Loop Feedback

Users submit positioning clarity input via the `PositioningFeedbackForm` component:

1. Form submission → Server Action (`submitPositioningFeedback`)
2. Insert into `positioning_feedback` table
3. Trigger calculates `impact_score` automatically
4. Profile `impact_score` is updated
5. Notification is created
6. User sees personalized thank-you message

### Public health endpoint (runtime connectivity)

**Status Endpoint**: `GET /api/status/health`

Returns **`kind: settler.runtime_connectivity`**: point-in-time probes for PostgreSQL (via Prisma), Supabase reachability, and required Supabase-related runtime environment validation. It does **not** aggregate product KPIs, engagement, or historical uptime.

**Related**: `GET /api/status` includes the same connectivity block plus coarse subsystem labels for dashboards.

Canonical mapping: `docs/launch/CLAIMS_AND_EVIDENCE_REGISTRY.md`.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Server Components (Read Operations)

- All data fetching happens in Server Components
- Direct Supabase queries with RLS enforcement
- No client-side data fetching for initial loads

### Server Actions (Write Operations)

- `signUpUser`: Creates auth user + profile + activity log
- `submitPositioningFeedback`: Inserts feedback, triggers impact score calculation
- `logActivity`: Tracks user engagement anonymously or with user_id

### Real-time Subscriptions

- Client Components subscribe to Supabase Realtime
- Posts and notifications update live
- All subscriptions are properly cleaned up on unmount

### External API Integration

- GitHub API for repository stats (with fallback to demo data)
- NPM API for package download stats (with fallback to demo data)
- All external data is clearly marked when using demo/fallback data

## 📝 Demo Data Strategy

- Demo data is clearly labeled and realistic
- No false claims or embellishments
- External APIs are used when available, with graceful fallbacks
- Sample data helps demonstrate system capabilities without misleading users

## 🔐 Security & RLS

All tables have Row-Level Security (RLS) enabled:

- **profiles**: Public read, own write
- **posts**: Published posts are public, drafts are private
- **activity_log**: Users can only see their own activity
- **positioning_feedback**: Users can only see their own feedback
- **notifications**: Users can only see their own notifications

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Implement authentication flow (login/logout)
2. Add post creation/editing functionality
3. Build notification center
4. Create user profile pages
5. Add search and filtering for posts
6. Implement upvote/downvote functionality
7. Add comment system
