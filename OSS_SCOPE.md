# Settler OSS Scope & Product Boundaries

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-23

This document defines the boundaries between Settler's **open-source SDK** (MIT licensed) and the **commercial Settler Cloud platform** (proprietary).

**NOT a complete reconciliation platform** — it's the tools to build one or connect to one.

### Settler Cloud (Commercial SaaS)
**What it is:** Fully managed reconciliation platform with infrastructure, engine, and adapters

**License:** Proprietary

**Purpose:** Provide a production-ready, scalable reconciliation service with:
- Managed infrastructure

## 💰 Monetization Model

### Open Source Strategy (SDKs)
**Business model:** Free forever, MIT licensed

**Why open source the SDKs?**
1. **Developer adoption**: Remove friction for trying Settler
2. **Ecosystem growth**: Enable community-built integrations
3. **Quality improvements**: Leverage community contributions
4. **Transparency**: Build trust with open client code
5. **Multi-language support**: Community can add new SDKs

**What we DON'T monetize:**
- SDK downloads or usage
- Protocol implementations
- React components
- CLI tool
- Documentation and examples

### Commercial Revenue (Cloud Platform)
**Business model:** Usage-based SaaS with tiered pricing

**What we DO monetize:**
1. **Reconciliation transactions** ($0.01 per transaction)
2. **Managed adapters** (included in Cloud subscription)
3. **Infrastructure** (API hosting, database, workers)
4. **Scheduled jobs** (automated reconciliations)
5. **Webhooks** (real-time event delivery)
6. **Developer Console** (monitoring and management)
7. **Enterprise features** (SSO, SLA, support)

**Pricing Tiers:**
- **Free**: 100 transactions/month (no credit card)
- **Starter**: $29/month + $0.01/transaction (1,000 included)
- **Growth**: $99/month + $0.01/transaction (10,000 included)
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing (volume discounts, SLA)

**Why usage-based?**
- Aligns cost with value delivered
- Scales with customer growth
- Predictable for customers
- Fair for all sizes (startups to enterprise)

## 🎓 OSS User Paths

### Path 1: Settler Cloud User (Recommended)
**Who:** Developers who want a managed solution

1. Install SDK: `npm install @settler/sdk`
2. Sign up at [settler.io](https://settler.io)
3. Get API key
4. Create reconciliation jobs
5. Monitor in Developer Console
6. Upgrade as you grow

**Cost:** Free tier → Paid tiers as usage grows

### Path 2: Self-Hosted (Advanced)
**Who:** Developers who want full control

1. Fork this repository
2. Implement your own reconciliation engine
3. Build custom adapters for your providers
4. Use protocol types for consistency
5. Host on your own infrastructure

**Cost:** Free (MIT license) + your infrastructure costs

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Full control and customization
- ✅ No per-transaction fees
- ✅ Data stays on your infrastructure
- ❌ Build and maintain your own engine
- ❌ Build and maintain provider adapters
- ❌ No managed infrastructure
- ❌ No official support

### Path 3: Hybrid
**Who:** Developers who want flexibility

1. Use Settler Cloud for production workloads
2. Self-host for development/testing
3. Use SDK and protocol types for both
4. Contribute improvements back to OSS

---

## 📊 Competitive Positioning

### vs. Fully Proprietary SaaS (e.g., Rutter, Merge)
**Advantage:** Open SDK reduces vendor lock-in, enables self-hosting

### vs. Fully Open Source (e.g., Airbyte)
**Advantage:** Managed Cloud is faster to start, no infrastructure needed

### Our Approach: "Open Core"
- **Core SDKs**: Open source (adoption)
- **Managed Platform**: Commercial (revenue)
- **Clear boundaries**: No "bait and switch"

---

## 🔮 Future Considerations

### Potential OSS Additions
We may open-source additional components in the future:
- Sample reconciliation engine (reference implementation)
- Example adapter implementations (Stripe, Shopify)
- Self-hosted dashboard template

**Decision criteria:**
1. Does it help adoption?
2. Does it reduce support burden?
3. Does it create competitive advantage for Cloud?
4. Is it sustainable to maintain?

### Potential Commercial Additions
We may add new commercial features:
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Multi-region deployment
- Custom SLA tiers
- White-label options

**Decision criteria:**
1. Is there customer demand?
2. Can we deliver quality?
3. Does it require managed infrastructure?
4. Is it financially sustainable?
